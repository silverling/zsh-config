# Silver's Zsh config

This repo contains my zsh config files. It's mainly based on `zinit` framework.

## Setup

```bash
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silverling/zsh-config/main/setup.sh | bash
```

This script will install `zsh` and `starship` if they are not installed, and then download the `zshrc` file to `~/.zshrc` and `starship.toml` to `~/.config/starship.toml`.
